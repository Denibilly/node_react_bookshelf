### API

A simple API has already been setup. This uses data from a sqlite database (included in this project). The API is powered by [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa), and uses [Bookshelf](https://bookshelfjs.org/) as an ORM.

To get started:

Inside the "api" folder: 
- run `npm install`
- run `node server.js`

### Frontend

A simple [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev) skeleton has already been setup. This includes basic configuration so it is ready to load data from the API.

Inside the "frontend" folder: 
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
